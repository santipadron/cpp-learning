# Santi's C++ Learning 
A collection of mini C++ programs to learn the language
## Why I'm learning C++
- I already learned C and Java in my first year of university, so it is good to learn C++ to refresh my skills in C as well as my OOP concepts from Java. I believe C is a poweful and interesting language, so I'm excited to learnabout C++, often considered a superset of C.
- I am interested in embedded systems and arduino programming, which uses C++ as its programming language. Learning the fundamentals will allow me to more easily build projects later.
- I want to build [this project](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/) of a CHIP-8 emulator, and eventually other emulators and systems. They require C++.
- Many hardware internships require proficiency in C/C++, so it is good to learn.
## Why do it in a github repo?
Why do all this learning, which let's be honest is mostly going to be "simple" small programs, in a public github repo. Why not simply learn by myself on my computer without the hassle of logging, commiting, and maintaining a repo?
- Accountability. Having this public on the internet gives me motivation to learn and actualyl code something. Even if it's a small thing, it's something I did and something to show
- Keep gaining more and more experience with version control systems and git. Although this is not a shared project where merge conflicts and branching will be happening, it is still good practice on having clean, consistent commits, and knowing how everything works.
- Journaling and documenting the process. By doing this I am also keeping all these steps stored somewhere, and I can look back and see how I learned and what I learned. This makes me think that I could also make a `log` file where I document the things I'm learning, struggling with, etc.
## How I'm learning C++
I'm currently following [this website](https://www.learncpp.com/) in order to learn the fundamentals of C++. As I keep learning I might add more ressources I used, and some other mini-projects/tutorials.
